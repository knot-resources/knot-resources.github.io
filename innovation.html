        The people that you want in your organisation probably have what it
        takes to start their own. It is becoming more necessary than ever to
        create workplaces where you demonstrate valuing a vibrant
        entrepreneurial community.

      <h1>How we do it</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>
          We get the people who do the work to uncover ideas about solving
          problems in new and better ways.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Create opportunities for growth of your organisation by tapping into
        your peopleâ€™s ingenuity. Take them out of the "doing" space that they
        are usually in and put them a "thinking" space to help you help them
        evolve your organisation.
      </p>

          Rewarding people equity in resulting business ventures
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        High performance and satisfaction have been linked to the need to
        direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better
        by ourselves and our world. The carrot and stick approach no longer
        work. Making employees shareowners of their own product engages them
        as your business enters into a new market or industry, whilst also
        creating a new product for that new market.

        <h1>Why we do it</h1>
        <p>
          People are our greatest asset in a world where knowledge and ideas
          are the new currency. Tapping into their ability to stay abreast of
          new technology presents new opportunities for businesses wanting to
          innovate.

          This is Sarah. She works in finance and was frustrated by the
          antiquated systems she needed to use to draw down funding to support
          business operations. Sarah brought in her ideas for Lift, an online
          invoice financing solution connecting SMEs to 'self serve' invoice
          financing directly from their existing accounting software account,
          such as Xero.
