      <h1>How we do it</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>We centre the candidate selection process around jobseekers.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our self-selection tool helps candidates to opt into conversations and
        eliminates unsuitable candidates early in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        After opting into a conversation, passing technical and behavioural
        tests and accepting an offer, new joiners are issued with our
        onboarding game.
        <strong>Centred around the new joinerâ€™s experience</strong>, our
        onboarding game facilitates interaction with key business people early.
        This is simplified to cover business critical operations and make
        learning about the organisation enjoyable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result? Your new joiner is primed to deliver value from
        <em>Day 1</em>.

        <p>
          This is Cale, Unboxed Intern (2015),
        </p>
        <p>
          Our onboarding tool primed him for his summer with Unboxed. He knew
          from day 1 that Unboxed trusted him to a great job which is how he
          came to pick a story from the project board that interested him. It
          related to visualising data on the Government Petitions site that
          Unboxed were working on.

          In the heat of
          <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215">Petition 131215</a>,
          <em>"EU Referendum Rules triggering a 2nd EU Referendum"</em>, the
          petition map was used by over 1 million users in a single day.
