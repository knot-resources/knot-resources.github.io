        <strong>We centre the candidate filtering process around candidates in recruitment.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our innovative self selection tool encourages candidates to opt into a conversation, reduces the
        amount of time spent speaking to the wrong candidate and eliminates unsuitable candidates early
        in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        After opting into a conversation, passing technical and behavioural tests and accepting an offer,
        new joiners are issued with our onboarding game.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Centred around the new joiner’s experience of induction</strong>, our onboarding game facilitates
        interaction with key business people in their early days, is simplified so that business critical operations
        are covered and makes learning about the organisation fun.
      </p>

      <p>The culmination of this primes your new joiner to deliver value from day 1...</p>

          This is Cale, Unboxed Intern (2014),
        </p>
        <p>
          Our onboarding tool primed him for his summer with Unboxed. He knew
          from Day 1 that Unboxed trusted him to a great job which is how he
          came to pick a story from the project board that interested him. It
          related to visualising data on the Government Petitions site that
          Unboxed were working on. He went back to Uni shortly before the
          terrible terrorist attacks in Paris.

        <p>
          Just after that Donald Trumped about not allowing muslim people into
          the USA resulting in XXX petition. Cale’s petition heat map saw
          this activity:

          We made this t-shirt and Unboxed wore it to the next grad fair:

        Onboarding shouldn't to be a hurdle to any new joiner's ability to
        contribute real value.
