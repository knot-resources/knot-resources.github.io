      <h1>How we do it</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Our What Good Looks Like tool is defined by employees</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We know that the easiest way to get somewhere is with a map; either for
        orientation or just to check that the route taken is the right one. Our
        people tool sets valued behaviours and skills as standard for realistic
        goal setting and maps the delivery of your purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Our career progression tools are centred around how employees want to grow</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you make Employees the Product Owners of their own growth and align
        those plans with your business strategy then everyone consciously drives
        in the same direction. Working with a sense of purpose, your employees
        are engaged and stay for longer.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Our mentoring tool facilitates peer review for succession</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A key element of this is for peers to recognise and appreciate their
        colleagues contributions. Our tool caters for reflection and recognition
        - driving continual improvement.

        <h1>Why we do it</h1>

        <p>
          This is Tom, Unboxed Intern (2012),
        </p>
        <p>
          Tom joined Unboxed as a Developer after graduating in 2013. In an
          ever-connected world of continuous feedback, he found being the
          Product Owner of his Growth project a very useful way of keeping
          track of his progress within Unboxed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is how he delivered the story called: “make myself known in the
          Ruby/JS/Web development community”, part of the epic called
          “Be Front End Lead”.
